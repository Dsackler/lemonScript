							One morning, a young Khalid awoke and decided to

							more than life itself” he muttered as he typed with
							a sour face. At that moment, he looked at the lemon
							pulp he has been collecting for the past 5 years due
							to his midnight lemon snack addiction. At that
							moment, he decided to call his much smarter and
							superior friend David to write him a language that
							everyone could enjoy. So, David formed a team with
							Brent, Julian, Justin, Raul, and Khalid with the
							intent to create a language for all lemon
							enthusiasts. The stage has been set. lemonScript was
							to be a self-explanatory, statically-typed, esoteric
							language with the sole purpose of saving people who
							had a sour taste in their mouth from using popular
							languages.
