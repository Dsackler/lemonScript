## lemonScript
One morning, a young Khalid awoke and decided to finish his A.I assignment. “Gosh, I just hate python more than life itself” he muttered as he typed with a sour face. At that moment, he looked at the lemon pulp he has been collecting for the past 5 years due to his midnight lemon snack addiction. At that moment, he decided to call his much smarter and superior friend David to write him a language that everyone could enjoy. So, David formed a team with Brent, Julian, Justin, Raul, and Khalid with the intent to create a language for all lemon enthusiasts. The stage has been set. lemonScript was to be a self-explanatory, statically-typed, esoteric language with the sole purpose of saving people who had a sour taste in their mouth from using popular languages.
